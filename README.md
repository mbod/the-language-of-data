Examining the patterns of language used to communicate data

-----


The increasing use of data in media and social media news means that readers require an increasing data literacy in order to understand correctly numbers statistics and charts. There is a growing literature on data and visual infomation literacy, which explores the common numeric metrics and types of charts and graphs that are seen in a large number of data driven articles and posts as well as the use of data dashboards and other visualizations and infographics. The recent pandemic has intensified this trend with infection and vaccination metrics and graphs becoming a central part of daily news and social media posts. Along with this phrases such as flattening the curve have entered the general vernacular. While tables and graphs  have increased  in prominence data insights are primarily communicated in words. The initial goal of this project is to carry out an empirical analysis of these kinds of documents to discover the common phrases and words used to communicate data.
